THE STEREO_MAPPING MODULE PROVIDES A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE WORLD, IN SCALE WITH REAL WORLD COORDINATE SYSTEM.
THE COMMAND LINE USAGE IS THE FOLLOWING:
	./stereo_mapping <camera_id> <birds_eye_mode> <show_reverse>
	
THE <camera_id> REQUIRED PARAMETER IS THE NUMBER OF THE STEREO CAMERA WANTED.

THE <birds_eye_mode> IS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
	B	VIEW_MODE_BIRDS_EYE			SHOWS THE BIRD'S EYE PROJECTION OF THE RIGHT CAMERA RAW IMAGE   
	O	VIEW_MODE_BIRDS_EYE_OPENCV	SHOWS THE BIRD'S EYE PROJECTION OF THE RIGHT CAMERA RAW IMAGE USING OPENCV METHOD
	R	VIEW_MODE_ROAD_FINDING		(DEFAULT) SHOWS A PROBABILISTIC MAP OF THE TRAVERSABLE REGION
	
THE <show_reverse> DEFINES, FOR DEBUGING PURPOSES, IF THE ROAD FINDING RESULTS ON AN INVERSE PERSPECTIVE IMAGE ARE GOING TO BE REPROJECTED TO THE RAW IMAGE. IS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
	N	DON'T REPROJECT
	Y	REPROJECT

STEREO_MAPPING MODULE HAS THE FOLLOWING INI PARAMETERS THAT CAN BE SET ON .ini FILES:
